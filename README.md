I want to make a standalone Spotify player so I don't need to take my phone with me.

This has been a project I've wanted to tackle for a while now. I've gotten so tired of 
social media and the plauge that smart phones have on an attention span, but being a 
music head makes it hard for me to go anywhere whithout it since I just want to listen
to music whereever/whenever I am. 

Seeing the project by Buy Dupont linked below, was the reason for starting this project, 
as I now know it can be done. I'm hoping his work can be utilized as as good launch point 
and I can learn from what he has already done.
